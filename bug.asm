mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10] ; This line attempts to access memory at an invalid address.  The calculation of the effective address might result in an address outside the allocated memory space for the program or attempting to access a protected memory region. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other unexpected behavior.

mov dword ptr [esi + edi*2], eax ; This line writes a value to memory. However, if the address calculated by esi + edi*2 is also invalid (possibly due to an incorrect index calculation, uninitialized pointers, or stack corruption), it will result in memory corruption, leading to unpredictable behavior.
